            <p>We were over at Luna Lake in Alpine yesterday, shorefishing for some trout. We were skunked all evening, we tried all kinds of baits, spinning lures, these darn trout weren't biting anything! I told my son Ledoux "one more cast", because it was getting awfully dark, the sun had already set. On his last cast, a trout bit onto the lure, and boy reeled in that sucker! </p>

            <p>I was fishing on the Verde River this morning, the bass were really loving the fluke baits. This was my first catch of the day, just a lil' guy, but he straight up inhaled that bait! That was a rough one to take out of his mouth, it was literally in his stomach! Good news, the little guy was safely returned to the waters!</p>
